This is just a very quick preliminary look at the data we have available so far. 
This work mostly compares number of whale sightings to number of warm core 
rings associated with the date of the whale sighting. If there was not a JC chart
for the exact date of the sighting I used the available chart from the closest 
date prior to the sighting. For instance, if a whale was sighted on 5/5/23, and 
there is not a chart on that day, I used a chart from 5/4/23 or 5/3/23. 



### Visualing Offshore Flight Summary Data

Sightings were summed across years. Bars indicate the whale sightings, where red 
represents right whales, green represents other large whales and yellow indicates unidentified large 
whales.

**Figure 2.** Number of whale sightings and number of rings with streamers 
over time. 

Bars indicate the whale sightings, where red represents right whales, 
green represents other large whales and yellow indicates unidentified large 
whales. The black line is the number of rings associated with a shelf streamer
present (West of -65W) on the date of sighting. Note, I did not have JC charts 
for all the years, thus the yellow points on top of the black line are showing 
the years for which I had JC charts to reference. This data is also based on a 
limited set of JC charts, with most years only having images from Jan-May.

**Figure 3.** Number of whale sightings and percentage of rings with streamers 
over time. 

Bars indicate the whale sightings, where red represents right whales, 
green represents other large whales and yellow indicates unidentified large 
whales. The black line is the percentage of all rings present (West of -65) that 
were associated with a shelf streamer on the given date of sighting. Note, 
I did not have JC charts for all the years, thus the yellow points on top of 
the black line are showing the years for which I had JC charts to reference.

### Kmeans clustering 

K-means clustering (MacQueen 1967) is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm 
for partitioning a given data set into a set of k groups (i.e. k clusters). 
The value K (the number of groups) is specified ahead of time.

This clustering is used to classify observations into k groups based on their 
similarity. Each group is represented by its center (cluster centroid), which 
correspsonds to the mean of the points assigned to the cluster. 

+ **objects within the same cluster are as similar as possible (i.e., high intra-class similarity)**, 

+ **objects from different clusters are as dissimilar as possible (i.e., low inter-class similarity)**

More details can be found [here](https://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/k-means-clustering-in-r-algorith-and-practical-examples/)



#### Right Whales: 

**Figure 4.** Cluster plot of Right whales and number of WCRs with shelf
streamers 

Each data point in the following scatter plot is colored  according to its
cluster assignment. In order to get a better sense of what these clusters 
represent, qualitative values were assigned to each variable. To do this, first,
the number of rings associated with a shelf streamer was divided by the total 
number of rings for a given date. Next, the resulting proportion of rings with
shelf streamers was categorized as either:

+ high (> 0.6, or > %60)
+ moderate (>= 0.3 < 0.6, or 31-59%)
+ low (< 0.3, or < %30)

This allowed me to represent the data points according to whether the rings
with streamers made up a high (circle), moderate (square), or low (triangle)
proportion of the total rings present on the day of the whale sighting. 

*Note, only rings west of -65W were counted for this tally. Going forward, we 
may want to specify a more specific latitudinal and longitudinal range.*

A few caveats to Kmeans clustering: 

1. Assumes prior knowledge of data and requires analyst to choose the appropriate
number of clusters (k) in advance
2. Final results are sensitive to initial random selection of cluster centers, 
outliers, and order of data. 
- This means, each algorithm run may lead to different clustering results.
